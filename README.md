# Fell Seal Growth Simulator
 A character growth simulator for the strategy RPG "Fell Seal: Arbiter's Mark"


# Usage

'Select Starting Job' - Use this dropdown box to select the job that your character will be created/level reset as. This determines their base stats, indicated in the seven 'Base stat' windows directly below.

'Select Job' - This dropdown allows you to select a job to gain levels in. Once selected, the stat growths and mastery bonus for the selected job will appear in the 'Stat Gain' and 'Mastery' windows.

'Master Job' - Checking this box will add the currently selected job to the list of mastered jobs.

'Master All' - Checking this will set all standard jobs to be mastered. Standard jobs are those which are not restricted to story characters, do not require special badges, and which do not come from mods.

'Levels to Gain': Enter the number of levels to gain in the currently selected job in this field.

'Add' - Adds the entered number of levels in the currently selected job. Calculated stats will appear in the 'Stats' window, and a summary of job levels and mastery bonuses will appear in the 'Details' window.

'Reset' - Resets all fields and stats to their initial values.

# Mod Support

As of the current version, there is no direct support for jobs added via mods. In the future, an adaptor program may be added to extend the job database to support modded jobs. In the meantime, you may still add modded jobs to the database manually by editing 'job_growths.dat' in a text editor(make sure to make a backup of the file before making any changes!).
